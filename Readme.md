# ML Playground

This repository is a collection of machine learning projects I am working on while learning and improving my ML skills.

I start each problem with a basic solution and then gradually enhance it by:
- improving data preprocessing
- adding feature engineering
- trying different models
- tuning and evaluating results

Most projects are based on Kaggle datasets and are developed using Jupyter notebooks.

This repository is meant for learning, experimentation, and continuous improvement.
